<p>Founded by Madeleine Scott in May 2019, South Dakota Ballet is the state's first professional ballet company. South Dakota Ballet exists to inspire, empower, connect and educate South Dakota's continuously diversifying communities through world-class performances and educational outreach programming.</p2>
<p>Founder Madeleine Scott said, <q cite="https://southdakotaballet.org/the-company/">There have been many times where I wanted nothing more than for my family to be able to see a certain performance or for them to hear a soul-piercing piece of music that I was so blessed to be performing to in front of a thousand people. I wanted them to be a part of it with me, but there was not a company in South Dakota for me to dance in</q></p>

<h4>In School</h4>
<p>At a school assembly, we will get your kids energized then teach your students the secret language of ballet. We will also inspire them by performing an excerpt from a famous piece of choreography in elaborate costumes all made by hand! We will empower them by encouraging them to try new movements! We like to engage each student in an uplifting and energetic way.</p>
<p>In addition to assemblies, we offer the opportunity for children to try dance through our workshops.  We aim to provide these workshops within a space at the hosting school such as the gym.Our workshops are taught by South Dakota Ballet Founder, Madeleine Scott, and a highly-skilled assistant.</p>
<p>In the future, we wish to create a scholarship program in which we can provide opportunities to promising students who participate in a South Dakota Ballet BEYOND. We to help continue the cultivation of their passion for dance so that their experience does not stop at the end of our time together. We wish to select gifted and committed children to be awarded a scholarship to a local studio after trying dance for the first time at one of our workshops. Please consider donating to this cause.</p>

<p>South Dakota Ballet is currently seeking corporate support for our educational outreach program South Dakota Ballet BEYOND [BEYOND the city…BEYOND the stage…BEYOND our limits!] </p>
<p>An outreach assembly and 4-day workshop cost us approximately $800 to provide with transportation, teaching wages, marketing materials for children to take home to, t-shirts for the children, electronic requirements for student registration, and preparation time.</p>
<p>South Dakota Ballet is a nonprofit organization that relies on individual contributions, grant funding, corporate sponsorship, and foundational support to carry out our mission. We can only work with what we have.</p>
